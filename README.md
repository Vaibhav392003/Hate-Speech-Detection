# Hate-Speech-Detection
This project is one of the know projects in Data Science which deals with the Controvertial or Hate proviting speech from social media.

To filter out unwanted messages, we developed an SMS Spam Classifier using data science techniques. Pandas meticulously 
organized troves of SMS data, while NLTK expertly parsed text, uncovering linguistic patterns that distinguished spam from genuine messages.
 Scikit-learn's powerful algorithms learned from this linguistic fingerprint, constructing a model capable of accurately categorizing new messages. 
Mathematical matrices captured these patterns, serving as the model's decision-making engine. By harnessing these tools, 
we successfully built a gatekeeper for SMS inboxes, ensuring only relevant and trusted messages reach their intended recipients.


Here's a described description of the SMS Spam Classifier project paragraph:

1. Tackling Unwanted Messages:

Focuses on the pervasive issue of spam messages, recognizing the need for effective filtering solutions.
Highlights the project's goal to develop a tool that can accurately identify and separate spam from genuine messages.
2. Data Science Arsenal:

Emphasizes the use of three key data science libraries:
Pandas: Organizing and managing large amounts of SMS data efficiently.
NLTK: Parsing text expertly to uncover linguistic patterns that distinguish spam from legitimate messages.
Scikit-learn: Constructing machine learning models capable of learning these patterns and making accurate classifications.
3. Linguistic Fingerprint and Decision-Making:

Introduces the concept of a "linguistic fingerprint" that captures unique patterns within spam and genuine messages.
Explains the use of matrices to store and represent these patterns, serving as the foundation for the model's decision-making process.
4. Gatekeeper for Inboxes:

Underscores the project's success in creating a tool that effectively filters spam messages.
Describes the model's role as a "gatekeeper," ensuring only relevant and trustworthy messages reach their intended recipients.
